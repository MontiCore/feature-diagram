> NOTE: <br>
This documentation is intended for  **modelers** who use the feature diagram languages.
The documentation for **language engineers** using or extending the feature diagram language is 
located **[here](fd-lang/src/main/grammars/FeatureDiagram.md)** and the documentation for using 
or extending the feature configuration language is located 
**[here](fd-lang/src/main/grammars/FeatureConfiguration.md)**.

# Feature Diagram Languages in MontiCore

The models of the feature diagram language are called *feature models*. 
A feature model describes a software or system family in terms of 
(user-experienceable) features. Feature models are used as variability models in
the context of software product lines. 
This documentation does not provide a general introduction to feature models
and their applications, as this is provided by several books (e.g., [[CE00]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/345203), [[CN01]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/501065)) and 
research papers ().
