/**
  FeatureConfigurationPartial defines models for partial feature configurations.
   Usually, a feature configuration explicates only *selected features* and
   does not differentiate *unselected features* and features, for which *no decision*
   has been made yet. Partial configurations explicate all three sets of features.
   Each feature of the referenced feature diagram must be contained in exactly
   one of these three sets.
